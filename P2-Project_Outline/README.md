Elevator Pitch:

What problem is it going to solve?
 
One of the joys of collecting is learning about the objects you collect. Documenting dates, purchase prices, and background information adds value to both the objects and the collection as a whole, and allows you to make informed decisions about new acquisitions. But how do you organize all of these details in one place? Moreover, how can you connect with like-minded enthusiasts and learn from the vast expertise of the crowd?
 
What goal do you intend to achieve?
 
Modeled on museum catalogs and databases, this app allows registered users to store and organize information about their collections, including purchase and provenance details, photographs, condition reports, and research notes. It also allows users to post and edit guides on categories of objects on which they have expertise. Both registered users and non-users can access these guides and fora to further their own research. 
 
Who is the audience?
Collectors of art, antiques, and other objects
Buyers/sellers researching objects they own or possible acquisitions
Buyers/sellers wishing to connect with other collectors
Collectors of all ages and backgrounds who have a passion about any area of collecting
UX/accessibility specific: Older adults who may require extra-intuitive and/or clear user interface 
UX/accessibility specific: Researchers who may need to use diacritical marks in their notes (although the app in general will be in English for now)

Potential working titles:         	
Loupe (after the magnifiers used by art conservators and appraisers; connotation of close examination, exploration, and attention to detail)
WeCollect [suggested by Anya, via Slack]
Recollect (similar to “WeCollect”, plays on collecting and also remembering/saving information)
Collectio (Latin for “collection”)
Curiouser (play on early collections, called “cabinets of curiosities”)
Album/Inventory/Cabinet/Curate (or some play on one of those words)
Curiate (mash up of Curious and Curate)
Curio (or Curia, plural)
WonderRoom (play on Wunderkammer--early German collections)
Dual meanings--early collection/museum, and “place of wonder” as in “I wonder….” (i.e. research resource)
CuriousLog (a combination of Curios and Catalog)
WonderLog (similar to WonderRoom)
 
Features (name and 1-2 sentence description):

Core “Need-to-Have” features:
A navigation bar for accessing various features of the app including
A home page to greet new users, tell them a bit about the app, and lay the foundation for a good user experience
A sign up form so new users can create a personal account and a searchable database to store user account information
A sign in form so authenticated users can access user-only portions of the app and fetch their collection information from the database
A form to add an item from a user’s collection, which includes form validation, ability to upload images and enter an item description, and the options to add, edit, and delete items
A collection display page to browse collections that shows thumbnail images and titles and the ability to search collections or filter them by category 
An item display page that shows a large image/images and a full description of the item, with the ability to search, browse, or go back to the collections page	

Additional “Nice-to-Have” features (add to the project if there is time):
Advanced search feature accommodating searches by year, title, condition, region, etc. (and possibly multiple of these characteristics)		
Ability to fetch, store, and display information from external APIs
Ability for users to communicate with one another, via public posts, discussion boards, and/or direct messaging
Custom Bootstrap theming
Research and implementation of accessibility best practices
Full mobile responsiveness and compatibility (could possibly include making use of inbuilt cameras for adding images)
Research into possibilities for real-world deployment of the app
A wish-list or searching-for feature allowing users to keep track of items they would like to add to their collections
A form for searching items for sale on external sites (such as eBay, WorthPoint, etc.)

Technologies to be used:

Front End/UX/UI
Angular 11 framework
Bootstrap (4) library
HTML
TypeScript
CSS
Sass
Adobe XD for wireframing and user testing
Linking to outside API services (nice-to-have feature)
Back End
Spring Boot
Java
CRUD repository 
MySQL
IntelliJ
OAuth for user login (and possible nice-to-have commenting feature)

Need to learn/challenges to solve:

For Core/Need-to-Have Features
How to connect Angular driven front end to SpringBoot back end 
Anya and Casey will need to learn some basic Spring Boot and IntelliJ, etc.
Anna, Tara, and Chandler will need to learn some basic Angular and VSCode, etc.
How to upload attachments and images and send to database
For secondary/Nice-to-Have Features
API-specific protocols/methods (if using API/s)
How to set up Angular environments to keep API keys private/secret (if using API/s)
How to create commenting, discussion, and/or user messaging functionality 
How to fully implement Bootstrap to make site fully responsive
Best practices for user accessibility 
Possibilities for real-world deployment (e.g. as Chrome extension, etc.)
